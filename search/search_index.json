This will only need to be done once per taxonomy. You may need assistance from someone with basic unix knowledge in following instructions here. We will walk you though the steps to make a new ontology project 1. Install requirements docker : Install Docker and make sure its runnning properly, for example by typing docker ps in your terminal or command line (CMD). If all is ok, you should be seeing something like: CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES git, for example bundled with GitHub Desktop 2. Download the wrapper script and pull latest ODK version Linux/Mac: seed-via-docker.sh PC: seed-via-docker.bat Make sure to save the wrapper script in your working directory and that the filetype is correct. You should have git installed - for the repo command to work perfectly, it requires a .gitconfig file in your user directory! First, make sure you have Docker running (you will see the Docker whale in your toolbar on a Mac) To make sure you have the latest version of the TDT installed, run in the command line docker pull brain-bican/tdt NOTE The very first time you run this it may be slow, while docker downloads necessary images. Don't worry, subsequent runs should be much faster! NOTE Windows users, occasionally it has been reported that files downloaded on a Windows machine get a wrong file ending, for example seed-via-docker.bat.txt instead of seed-via-docker.bat , or, as we will see later, project.yaml.txt instead of project.yaml . If you have problems, double check your files are named correctly after the download! 3. Run the wrapper script You can pass in a configuration file in YAML format that specifies your taxonomy project setup. You can use dir in your command line on PC to ensure that your wrapper script, .gitconfig, and project.yaml (if you so choose) are all in the correct directory before running the wrapper script. Unix (Max, Linux) Using the predefined CCN202204130_project_config.yaml file: ./seed-via-docker.sh -C examples/human_m1/CCN202204130_project_config.yaml Windows Using the predefined CCN202204130_project_config.yaml config file: seed-via-docker.bat -C examples/human_m1/CCN202204130_project_config.yaml This will create your starter files in target/human_m1 . It will also prepare an initial release and initialize a local repository (not yet pushed to your Git host site such as GitHub or GitLab). Problems? There are three frequently encountered problems at this stage: No .gitconfig in user directory Spaces is user path During download, your filenames got changed (Windows) No .gitconfig in user directory The seed-via-docker script requires a .gitconfig file in your user directory. If your .gitconfig is in a different directory, you need to change the path in the downloaded seed-via-docker script. For example on Windows (look at seed-via-docker.bat ): docker run -v %userprofile%/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig -v %cd%:/work -w /work --rm -ti brain-bican/tdt /tools/tdt.py seed %* %userprofile%/.gitconfig should be changed to the correct path of your local .gitconfig file. Spaces is user path We have had reports of users having trouble if there are paths (say, D:\\data ) contain a space symbol, like D:/Dropbox (Personal) or similar. In this case, we recommend to find a directory you can work in that does not contain a space symbol. You can customize at this stage, but we recommend to first push the changes to you Git hosting site (see next steps). During download, your filenames got changed (Windows) Windows users, occasionally it has been reported that files downloaded on a Windows machine get a wrong file ending, for example seed-via-docker.bat.txt instead of seed-via-docker.bat , or, as we will see later, project.yaml.txt instead of project.yaml . If you have problems, double-check your files are named correctly after the download! 4. Push to Git hosting website The development kit will automatically initialize a git project, add all files and commit. You will need to create a project on you Git hosting site. For GitHub: Go to: https://github.com/new The owner MUST be the org you selected with the github_org option in the project yaml file. Repo name should be same with the repo option Do not initialize with a README (you already have one) Click Create See the section under \"\u2026or push an existing repository from the command line\" For GitLab: Go to: https://gitlab.com/projects/new The owner MUST be the org you selected with the github_org option in the project yaml file. Repo name should be same with the repo option Do not initialize with a README (you already have one) Click 'Create project' See the section under \"Push an existing Git repository\" Follow the instructions there. E.g. (make sure the location of your remote is exactly correct!). cd target/human_m1 git remote add origin https://github.com/hkir-dev/human_m1.git git branch -M main git push -u origin main Note: you can now mv target/human_m1 to anywhere you like in your home directory. Or you can do a fresh checkout from github.
